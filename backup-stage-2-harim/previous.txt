                <p>
                    This web app assist and guide people as they begin their first hike and track their progress in future hikes. 
                    Hiking is a great way for one to connect with and enjoy nature around them. Most people, such as myself this summer, 
                    have been wanting to get started with a trail so like anyone would do, we take to the internet and research 
                    everything before going out. Most sites immediately tell you about all the gear you need to go through the hike: 
                    backpacks with water packs, waterproof jackets, hiking boots and socks. After buying hundreds of dollars worth of 
                    equipment and finally go to the trail you are met with the beginner’s trail that you chose that you finished in 2 hours. 
                    All that equipment that you bought was unnecessary to the small trip that you made that day. 
                </p>

                    Most hiking apps out there tell you that the elevation is however many feet and however many miles long but that 
                    doesn’t really inform a beginner about what they will need for that trail. A beginner might think that all that 
                    equipment was crucial to the surviving out in the wilderness but really wasn’t. Most apps out there aren’t targeted 
                    towards beginners and spill out a bunch of information that seems like Greek to someone who is just starting out. 
                    I would like to make this app with beginners in mind and cater specifically out to them, but also have options for 
                    hiking veterans. Through an account-based system this app could really provide the proper information to those who 
                    need it, such as equipment people usually take on that specific trail, current weather conditions on the trail, and 
                    other stats in terms that beginners could understand/visualize.

                            experience. This page would show a map of the trail, gain/elevation, a description of the trail, usual equipment 
                            necessary for the trail, and comments made by other hikers using the app.

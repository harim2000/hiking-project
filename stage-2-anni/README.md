Topic Overview

Whether you just moved to Washington State or you've been here for your whole life, people here are big on hiking. Mt. Rainier, Rattle Snake, Lake 22... You name it. Washington is the perfect hiking place if you're active and in love with nature. If you're thinking about going on a hike, there're couple things you should search for first, like parking permits. You might not know they exist until now. The good news is, we're here to help. The goal of this website is to tackle the pain of finding hiking permits for amateur hikers.

You might be wondering, why is this necessary? Aren't there websites like Washington Trails Association that helps you find all the information? The answer is, yes, kind of. We've looked through couple websites like the one you mentioned, but they don't really tell you a whole lot about hiking permits. Another problem with hiking cites is parking. Parking is crazy in WA.

Do you know which one is the best value hiking permit?
Do you know the different types of permits in Washington?
Do you have a hard time looking for parking spots?
People in Washington State love to go hiking, but it could be a real hassle sometimes. It's true that there're tons of websites out there to help, but it's so hard to get all the information you need. Most of the websites out there focus mainly on a specific hiking spot. Usually when people impulsively decide to go on a hike, they can't get their parking permits right away. According to Local Advanturer, some hiking permits are quite hard to get due to popularity and protection of the nature. It's also quite confusing with which parking permit to use since there're so many of them.

If that sounds like you, you're at the perfect site.

Potential Applications

In this website, you'll find information about one or some of the following:

types of parking permits
Since there're so many different types of parking permit, why don't we make a website of them. In the app, it can include the types, how to apply, the cost and the duration. Users can put in the hiking spots they're most interested in, and the app will help users to find the best value package.

location for each permit
The location can be made into a map. When you select one permit, it highes the location of the hiking place and user can better utilize their permits. It can also help the users to explore new places.

parking location for each hiking place
Parking has always been a big problem too. This app can include the potential parking lots. But also the free/available parking lots. It can also include the best time to go hiking and how many spots left.

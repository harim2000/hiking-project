        <h1> Issues in Wilderness Recreation </h1>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p> Outside of any professional ambitions, most of my passions are related to enjoying
            the natural beauty of the world. Some of the best days of my life have been spent
            away from any connection to technology, enjoying the natural beauty and solitude
            of the wilderness. Whether its hiking, backcountry skiing, or climbing I believe
            everyone can benefit from some peace, quiet, and connection to the outdoor world.
            Because of this, I have decided to address the question of how we can improve access
            to outdoor recreation while reducing our impact on the planet.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p> Unfortunately planning a trip into the wilderness is not an easy task, and requires consolidating
            information across a variety of sources. Additionally, to keep wilderness areas pristine, permits are often
            required for camping or day use, and can be confusing to obtain. Due to their annoying nature, permits are
            often not filled out, which leaves the agencies who maintain public land with incomplete information about
            the types of use their areas are seeing. A perfect example is the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/wilderness-reservations.htm"> 
            Olympic National Park </a> backcountry permits site. It has disjointed information, and does not offer a way to
            obtain permits online. Furthermore, there are opportunities to make natural recreation more accessible for those 
            who are disabled or disadvantaged, and these are the people who would benefit the most from a closer connection 
            to the natural world.

        <h2>Potential Web App Solutions</h2>
        <p>Bellow I have listed a couple of ideas that could solve information problems that are present in the world of 
        outdoor recreation.
        </p>

        <ul>
            
            <li>Wilderness Planning and Reservation System 
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a better interface for reserving wilderness permits</li>
                    <li>Join with <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/">weather </a> and <a href="https://www.summitpost.org/">route information</a> to make planning simple </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Improving access for Individuals with Disabilities
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a comprehensive list of areas where it is possible for individuals with disabilities 
                            to enjoy the outdoors</li>
                        <li>Build new tools to make planning for disabled persons simple </li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

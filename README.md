# Hike Finder App [link](https://info340a-au18.github.io/project-kylegoodwin/)

How we combined our work:

Harim: Added Pagination and get my location from his project.

Anni: Built results cards with added star ratings and difficulty ratings. Added loading animaitons for better user experience and better error messages.

Kyle: Added map, handled ajax requests, and built filtering system.

How to use:

1. Scroll down to the first input labeled "Starting city or address"

2. Input any format of location

3. Select a maximum distance you are willing to drive on the slider bellow.

Now a map with hikes near you will show up, aswesll as card resluts showind details about all the hikes.

Above the map, there is a way you can filter the results shown in the map / on the results section.

You can:

1. Use the first slider to input a range to filter the hike results by.

2. Use the second slider to input a range of elevation gains to filer the hikes by

3. Select a method of sorting the cards with the 3 buttons.

Enjoy!

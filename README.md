# Hike Finder App [link](https://info340a-au18.github.io/hiking-project/#/)

How we combined our work:

Harim: Added Pagination and get my location from his project. Started the individual information pages and worked on routing and hosting with GH-Pages.

Anni: Built results cards with added star ratings and difficulty ratings. Added loading animaitons for better user experience and better error messages. Change the layout of the search page and the account page. Added scroll to top bottom. 

Kyle: Added map, handled ajax requests, and built filtering system. Added the react-router path for the individual hikes, and built the individual hikes page. Helped with design throughout. 

Larissa: Added the ability to save and remove hikes when a user is logged in. 

Kateka: Added the review functionality where each user can leave and edit their own reviews for each hike.

How to use:

  The page will start up with map and the trails listed, with a filtering system so that you can search through the hikes you want to look at. Each of the trail elements is formatted as a card that shows brief information about the page. Each card has a button which links to an individual page for the trail showing more information. This page also allows you to see and create comments about the hike. The card also contains a button which, when you are logged in, allows you to save the the trails in a personal database so that you can go back and look at them at a later time. 
  
  To create an acocunt, or to just log in, you have to click on the Account button at the top right corner of the page in the navbar, and input your information into the form provided. Once you have an account, the account page shows you your information (username and image), the trails you've saved, and the comments youve made on the trails.

Filtering-

1. Scroll down to the first input labeled "Enter Location"

2. Input any format of location or you can click on the marker icon to get the location of where you are at.

3. From the originally hidden filter menu, you can select a maximum distance you are willing to drive on the slider below, filtering the difficulty of the hikes you are looking for, and filtering through a range of different hike elevations you want to look at.

Now a map with hikes near you will show up, aswesll as card resluts showind details about all the hikes.

Above the map, there is a way you can filter the results shown in the map / on the results section.


Enjoy!
